# P2: Finding Fish Lists

***Due Date***: September 20, 2018.

Remember that we will have P3 opening on that day, so don't save it until the last minute!

### Program Compiles (=30)
This includes that your code should be professional. 
- Try to proofread your work like an essay! 
- Find all your ``println("stuff")`` statements and remove them, etc.
- Your code looks intentional: don't just fiddle with it until it works. Reason about it! Sketch out the python by hand and then try translating to Java.
- Delete commented out code or experiments that don't work out. Make your submission as small as it needs to be.
- Your code is your own. Respect the honor code.
- Working with others or helping them debug is acceptable - use your best judgment! Make sure that you know what you're working on.
- Have comments explaining tricky code!

### Lab warm-up.

## PlayFish class
 - Play the game (WASD or arrow keys).
 - Change VISUAL_GRID_SIZE to be bigger so you can see details (but not so big it doesn't fit on your screen!).
 - Change LOGICAL_GRID_SIZE to be some version of this -- bigger games take longer to play, small games will eventually need some tuning.

## Fish class Tour
The Fish class for P2 is familiar, but much simpler! It lives on a Grid and doesn't move itself.
- Play the game. You collect all the fish. (They just disappear when you get them now).
- Add fish-colors. The 'COLORS' static array has a list of a few colors. Create more.
